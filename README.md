# CRUD application

Developed by @thisiszoaib

This app is a basic contacts app showing CRUD operations using the Angular Signals implementation - which has just been released in v16.
Services are used to add artificial delay to mimic an API call - will be updating this to showcase more of signals and what they bring to the table with Angular.

## App uses Angular v19, Angular Signals, Angular Material
